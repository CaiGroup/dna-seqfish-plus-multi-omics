# Comparing cell shape before and after FISH protocol 

Image stacks of live nuclei are in the `cropped_live_nuc_pore_padded folder`, and image stacks of the same cells after a mock seqFISH protocol are in the  `cropped_fix_its1_padded` folder. All stacks are cropped and padded so that the image stacks of each cell while live and after the mock seqFISH protocol are the same same.
