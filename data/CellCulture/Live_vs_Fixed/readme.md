# Comparing cell shape before and after FISH protocol 

Image stacks of live nuclei are in the `cropped_live_nuc_pore_padded folder`, and image stacks of the same cells after a mock seqFISH protocol are in the  `cropped_fix_its1_padded` folder. All stacks are cropped and padded so that the image stacks of each cell while live and after the mock seqFISH protocol are the same same.

Fit points in the nuclei for each image were obtained as described in our manuscript and are in the `filtered_live_pnts` and `fit_fix_its1` folders. Cell heights derived from these points are listed in `cell_heights.csv`.
